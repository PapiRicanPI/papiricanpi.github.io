# Wiring Your Google Sheets (Data Links)

Edit `assets/js/data-links.js` and paste the **Share** links for your live Google Sheets:
- Form Responses
- Vetting Responses
- Evidence Drop Responses
- Approvals_Tracker
- Poverty_Pimps_Masterlist
- Exposed_Names_Index (Sheet and/or CSV)

If you don't have a link yet, leave it blank — the button will show a small alert instead of a broken link.

The Home button uses: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/

## Where these links appear
- `index.html` → "Data & Sheets" card
- Optional snippet for `VaultOps_Console.html`: see `docs/VaultOps_Console_DataBlock.html`.
  Copy-paste the block into your console page if you want the same buttons there.
