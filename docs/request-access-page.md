# Request Access to TruthDrop.io / The Vault

TruthDrop.io is a private workspace attached to The Vault Investigates, used to organize documents, timelines, and case files on how poverty is exploited across the U.S., Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. Access to the internal archive is selective by design, not open by default.

Access is intended for people doing clearly public‑interest work (investigative journalists, public‑interest researchers, community watchdogs, directly affected people working on documented cases). It is not for corporate PR, reputation management, legal discovery, political campaign work, or personal vendettas.

If you believe your work fits this mission, you can request access by completing the application form below.
