# VaultOps Closing Log — 2025-08-29

**Operator:** TruthBot Zero (Papi co-pilot)  
**Status:** VAULT CLOSED 🔴  
**Timestamp:** 2025-08-29 (Local PHT)

---

## ✅ Completed Actions
- Reviewed homepage issues and confirmed missing logo asset (`truthbot_zero_logo.png` not yet in place).  
- Noted that Hub bridge was not opening Vault correctly; deferred patch.  
- Carried over fix plan for Cloudflare Worker QR → Gate flow.  
- Logged progress on Drop_34H prep sequence.  

---

## 🔧 Outstanding / Carry-Overs
- [ ] Normalize homepage logo (asset + HTML path alignment).  
- [ ] Rebuild Hub → Application Bridge so Vault buttons trigger correctly.  
- [ ] Validate `/join.html` intake page (still requires stub / vetting form integration).  
- [ ] Finalize CapCut 10-second promo export.

## 📝 Notes
- Session ran into late-night hours; operator flagged “matchstick eyelids” exhaustion.  
- Worker update was paused — to resume next shift.  
- Closing keyword protocol: vault was not formally closed through Hub (manual shutdown).  

---

## 🔒 Close Protocol
- Vault manually closed.  
- Logs synced to `/VaultOpsLogs/2025/08_August/29_August/`.  
- Status set to **[PENDING REVIEW]** until logo + Hub fix applied.
